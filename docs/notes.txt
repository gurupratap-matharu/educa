AUTH

For now we use the Django's Authentication system in our platform. Both instructors and
students will be instances of Django's User model, so they will be able to login and 
logout using the authentication views of django.contrib.auth


CMS

The cms allows instructors to create courses and manage their contents. We need to 
provide the following functionality:

    - login into the cms
    - list the courses created by the instructor
    - Create, edit and delete courses
    - Add modules to a course and reorder them
    - Add different types of content to each module and reorder them

API

Our API needs to provide the following functionality:
    - Retrieve subjects
    - Retrieve available courses
    - Retrieve course contents
    - Enroll on a course
